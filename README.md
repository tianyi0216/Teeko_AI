# Teeko_AI

This is an extension from a class project I implemented for my AI class at UW-Madison.

The original project is a textual interface for the game Teeko, which is a 4x4 board game where players take turns placing pieces on the board. The goal is to get 4 pieces in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The first player to do so wins.

The AI is implemented using the minimax algorithm with depth. The AI is able to beat a random player 100% of the time. 

The extension I added was a graphical interface for the game. I used the pygame library to create a GUI for the game. The GUI allows the user to play against the AI. 

To run the game, run the command `python3 teeko_gui.py` in the terminal.

To run the original text-based game, run the command `python3 teeko.py` in the terminal.

Requirements:
- Python 3
- Pygame
